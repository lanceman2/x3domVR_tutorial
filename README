This is a progression of x3DOM, x3d, javascript, HTML5, and CSS
examples that run in a browser.

Ports:
  Currently using firefox on Xubuntu 10.04 (and 16.04).

Examples are in numerical order in directories named:


    ###_min_*   minimal code in order to get the concept

    ###_x_*     there is some superfluous code

    ###_xx_*    there is even more code


In theory these examples should work from local files via URL
  file://home/USER/x3domVR_tutorial/
as well as:
  http://localhost/x3domVR_tutorial/run_index.php
or
  http://localhost/x3domVR_tutorial/
